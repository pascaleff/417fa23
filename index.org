* Course outline

- *Description:* This course is an introduction to the modern abstract
  theory of algebra and algebraic structures. The primary focus is on
  the theory of *groups*, which are "abstract groups of composable
  transformations;" key examples include the symmetries of a geometric
  figure, and the permutations of a set. Our focus is on constructing
  groups, understanding their structure, and developing techniques for
  classifying them.
  At the end of the course we also begin the study of *rings and
  fields*, which are "abstract number systems" in which there are
  abstract versions of the four arithmetic operations: addition,
  subtraction, multiplication, and (in the case of fields) division.

- *Lectures:* Lectures will be held in person. Written notes for the
  lectures will be made available. Please see the links in the
  schedule below.

- *Homework:* There will be 11 homework assignments whose due days
  (usually Fridays) are listed in the schedule. Homework must be
  submitted on paper in class. There is no homework due on weeks when
  there is an exam.

- *Exams:* There will be two midterm exams and a final exam. The
  midterm exams will be held in class on *Friday, September 29* and
  *Friday, November 3*. The final exam will be held *Wednesday, December 13, 8:00--11:00am in 169 Davenport Hall*.

* Policies

- *Assessment:* Grades will be based on homework (25%), two midterm
  exams (22% each), and the final exam (31%). The two lowest homework
  scores will be dropped. Grade cutoffs will never be stricter than
  90% for an A- grade, 80% for a B-, and so on. Individual exams may
  have grade cutoffs set more generously depending on their
  difficulty.

- *Homework assignments* should be submitted *on paper in class* on
  the due date. If you are unable to come to class, you may turn in
  your homework to *James Pascaleff's mailbox in 250 Altgeld Hall.*
  This mailbox will be checked at Noon on the due date, so you
  should have your homework in the box by that time.

- *Late homework* will not be accepted, but the lowest two scores are
  dropped, so you may miss one or two assignments without penalty.

- *Missed exams:* If you need to miss an exam (for reasons such as
  illness, accident, or family crisis), please let the instructor know
  as soon as possible, so that arrangements can be made.

- *Collaboration and Academic Integrity:* For homework assignments,
  collaboration is permitted and expected, but you must write up your
  solutions individually and understand them completely. On exams, no
  collaboration is permitted.

- *Disability accommodations:* Students who require special
  accommodations should contact the instructor as soon as
  possible. Any accommodations on exams must be requested at least one
  week in advance and will require a letter from DRES.
